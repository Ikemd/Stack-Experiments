# Stack-Experiments

Make4Covid uses specific designs of the Prusa face shield headbands that are specifically
signed off on by our medical staff and facilities.  Make4Covid intends to have all makers
with all types of printers be able to support the effort by scaling their production.

This repo is for testing of stacked Prusa RC3 headbands on all types of printers, starting 
with Prusa and expanding to other more common printers. Our hope is to get some .3mf files
that include the design and printer settings to improve overall headband throughput
with stacking.

THESE DESIGNS ARE UNSUPPORTED.  Make4Covid is currently supporting inexperienced makers with
printing published designs.  These are not official published for general use / support (yet).

If you want to help hop on the zoom channel and talk to Justin Teitelbaum, Patrick Bailey, or 
anyone there working on stacks :)

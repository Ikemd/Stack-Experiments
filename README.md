# Stack-Experiments

This repo is for testing stacking Prusa RC3 headbands.
Our hope is to get some .3mf files that include the design and printer settings to 
improve overall headband throughput with stacking

If you want to help hop on the zoom channel and talk to Justing Teitelbaum, Patrick Bailey, or 
anyone there working on stacks :)
